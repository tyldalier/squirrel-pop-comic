<h1>Welcome to comic_git!</h1>

<div id="comic-git-dev-banner">
    <p><b>This version of comic_git is obsolete. You can find the recommended version <a href="https://ryanvilbrandt.github.io/comic_git_dev/">here</a>, but read below for important info.</b>

    <p>I've been working on a major revamp of comic_git for a while. This new version has a major overhaul in the underlying system for how the website is built, which gives the benefit that I can provide bug fixes and updates to existing users automatically. It also contains many small but needed improvements, like an improved default theme.

    <p>However, although that revamp is completely code-ready, and is already actively being used by at least two active webcomics, it is not yet "ready" for a full release. Mainly, the documentation has not been updated as needed to cover all the changes in the new version, due mostly to a lack of motivation on my part. Despite that, the documentation is still correct and useful enough that I feel comfortable recommending this "new" version of comic_git to anyone who wants to use it.</p>

    <p>If you run into any issues using this "new" version, please don't hesitate to ask for help on our <a href="https://discord.gg/zmdHGXB">Discord server</a>.</p>
